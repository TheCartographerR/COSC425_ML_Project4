# COSC425_ML_Project4
Project 4: Back-Propagation. In this project we applied multilayer artificial neural nets (ANNs) to spam email classification.

Our goal with this project was to accurately classifiy email data as either spam or not spam. The email data is provided in the spambase.data.

Essentially, the neural network starts by making a prediction given a training set of data. After the predictions are made given the training set, an error value is calculated to compare how well the neural network's prediction performed. Weight values along the neural network's nodes are adjusted to compensate for the error value. Then lastly, the cycle repeats by again making a new prediction given a new training set. This continues until the error hopefully diminishes to an acceptable threshold. As you will likely discover, this lab proved quite challenging.
