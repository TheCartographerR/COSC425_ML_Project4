Project 4: Back-Propagation. In this project we applied multilayer artificial neural nets (ANNs) to spam email classification.

Our goal with this project was to accurately classifiy email text as spam or not based on the provided text in the spambase.data file via a back-progagation in a written from scratch Neural Network.
